    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Kelly Halfaker and I'm a psychology graduate turned
      software engineering student. Since graduating with my BA from UC Santa
      Cruz, I've discovered and pursued my interest in coding. Whether
      developing apps or working on web pages, coding has served me well as an
      outlet where I can synthesize my passion for problem solving and
      creativity.

    <h3>Creative Endeavors and Coding</h3>
    <p>
      <b>I absolutely love to create.</b> Whether from paint and paper, fabric
      and thread, or lines of code and a computer, making something beautiful
      and cohesive from where there was once nothing is more than a hobby for
      me. I spend much of my free time writing, making art, and putting together
      costumes all while constantly challenging myself to learn and integrate
      new techniques to better the quality and intricacy of my creations. When
      it's time to hop into developer mode, I keep this mindset with me and take
      special care to foster my inquisitive nature when I program. I'm always
      eager for more exposure to the ever-growing mediums available for
      swatching on the canvas of computer science so that I might have the
      opportunity to apply them to my own work!
    </p>
    <h3>What I've Been Working on Lately</h3>
    <p>
      Since my recent graduation from Actualize, a Chicago-based coding
      bootcamp, I have been in pursuit of further education closer to where I
      intent to work: Northern California. I applied to and was accepted into
      the immersive software development bootcamp at Rithm, based in San
      Francisco. Presently, I am working towards my graduation there in
      preparation to seek employmemt as a full stack developer.
